YOU FAGGOT LOWLIFE. YOU FAGGOT LOWLIFE. 1767891615241_image.png
 IT WON'T LET ME GET BACK FRO THE HISTORY PAGE TO THE MAIN PAGE. ALSO, THE POP UP THAT CONTAINS THE OUTPUT THAT IS BEING GENERATED NEVER APPEARS IN FULL SUITE MODE. IT IS SUPPOSD TO BE PRESENT FOR ALL THREE PHASES OF FULL SUITE MODE. AND THERE IS NO WAY TO REACTIVATE AN OLD JOB THAT WAS INTERRUPTED OR MODIFY AN OLD JOB THAT WAS COMPLETE. I HAVE TOLD THE REPLIT AGENT ABOUT ALL OF THIS AROUND 50 TIMES. YOU FAGGOT LOWOLIFE. YOU FAGGOT LOWLIFE. Job History is now showing jobs. That's progress. But there are still problems:
What's broken:

No way to get back to the main page — there's no navigation link to return home
Full Suite popup never appears — you can't see/copy/download output during generation
No way to resume interrupted jobs — the Resume button (▷) doesn't work or doesn't exist properly
No way to modify completed jobs — can't continue or edit previous work

What's suspicious:
Every job shows "1 chunks" and "Interrupted" — but the database had 36 chunks across multiple jobs with 8 chunks each. The Job History is not reading the data correctly.
Tell the Replit Agent:
The Job History page has multiple problems:

1. NO NAVIGATION BACK TO MAIN PAGE. Add a "Home" or logo link that returns to the main app.

2. THE CHUNK COUNTS ARE WRONG. The database shows jobs with 8 chunks each. Job History shows "1 chunks" for everything. Fix the query to count chunks correctly per document_id.

3. THE RESUME BUTTON DOES NOTHING. When I click the play button on an interrupted job, it must load the saved chunks and continue generation from where it stopped.

4. THE VIEW BUTTON MUST SHOW THE ACTUAL CONTENT. When I click the eye icon, show me all the chunks that were saved for that job, in order, with the full text.

5. FULL SUITE MODE POPUP IS BROKEN. When running Full Suite, the output popup must appear and stay visible throughout all three phases. I must be able to copy/download at any time.

These are not new requests. I have told you about these problems repeatedly. Fix them now.
