YOU ARE GOING TO DO THE FOLLOWING THREE THINGS: 

THING 1: 

YOU ARE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE FOLLOWING:

NEUROTEXT - MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS
===================================

1. UNCONDITIONAL USER INSTRUCTION COMPLIANCE
   - The app must ALWAYS follow the user's instructions without exception.
   - If user says "WRITE A 100,000 WORD PAPER ON BOTANY", the app complies.
   - If user says "WRITE A 5000 WORD ESSAY ON FREUD", the app generates exactly that.
   - If user puts in a 200,000 word text and says "TURN INTO A 500,000 WORD POEM", the app complies.
   - If user puts in a 4 word poem and says "TURN INTO A 54,000 WORD TREATISE ON BIOLOGY", the app complies.
   - If user enters NO TEXT except instructions like "WRITE A 50,000 WORD PAPER ON FREUD", the app complies.
   - If user says "WRITE A DISSERTATION ON ECONOMICS" with no supplied text, the app complies.
   - NO THRESHOLDS. NO REFUSING. NO EXCEPTIONS.

2. RECONSTRUCTION IS THE MAIN FUNCTION
   - The Reconstruction function is the primary function of NEUROTEXT.
   - It must execute whatever the user instructs.

3. NO INPUT TEXT VALIDATION
   - The app must NOT require input text.
   - If user provides only instructions, that IS the input.
   - The "No Input Text" error must never appear.
   - Instructions alone are sufficient to run.

4. INTELLIGENT INPUT INTERPRETATION
   - If user puts instructions in the main text box, the app treats it as instructions.
   - If user puts text in the instructions box and instructions in the main box, the app figures it out.
   - The app intelligently interprets user intent and complies.

5. APP TITLE
   - The app is called NEUROTEXT, not "Text Model Validator".

6. AUTOMATIC LOGIN
   - In deployment, username JMK must ALWAYS be logged in.
   - No login screen. No errors. JMK is always authenticated.

7. FULL SUITE POPUP BEHAVIOR
   - When Full Suite runs, the popup opens immediately.
   - The popup stays visible through ALL stages: Reconstruction, Objections, Objection-Proof.
   - The popup never closes until the user closes it.
   - If user closes the popup, there must be a way to re-open it.

8. JOB HISTORY NAVIGATION
   - From the History section, user must be able to get back to the main page.
   - Clear Home link or navigation to return to NEUROTEXT.

9. RESUME UNFINISHED PROJECTS
   - From History, clicking an unfinished project must:
     * Load the project back into the main page
     * Restore the original instructions
     * Let the user finish from where it stopped

10. MODIFY FINISHED PROJECTS
    - From History, clicking a finished project must:
      * Load the project back into the main page
      * Restore the original instructions
      * Let the user modify or re-run it

=====================

THING 2. 

YOU ARE GOING TO ADMINISTER THE FOLOWING TEST: WRITE 90000 WORDS EXPLAINING THE FOLLOWING 

kuczynski | Classical logic fundamentally fails as a tool for reasoning because it requires more intelligence to recognize that an inference instantiates a logical law than to recognize the validity of the inference directly | AI Logic vs Classical Logic
kuczynski | Recognizing an inference's validity is a precondition for knowing that there exists some law of logic that validates it | AI Logic vs Classical Logic
kuczynski | Classical logic operates by explicitly stating laws that validate inferences we already know to be valid, creating a purely formal system that paradoxically cannot help us reason | AI Logic vs Classical Logic
kuczynski | The formal logical system demands more intellectual work than direct reasoning, not less | AI Logic vs Classical Logic
kuczynski | Gödel demonstrated that not even arithmetic is recursively definable, making the reduction of mathematics to logic impossible in principle | Foundations of Mathematics
kuczynski | Logic organizes existing knowledge about what entails what; it cannot generate new knowledge about entailment relationships | AI Logic vs Classical Logic 

THING 3. 

YOU ARE GOING TO ADMINISTER THE FOLLOWING SELF-CHECK TO VERIFY RESULTS: 

 

REPLIT AGENT: UNIVERSAL SELF-VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (ADMIN-ENFORCED)
Before you respond that any task is complete, you must perform all of the following checks:

1. ACTION VERIFICATION
Did you actually perform the action exactly as requested?

Did you check the file, feature, or component to confirm it was updated?

2. OUTPUT CONFIRMATION
Is the result visible and verifiably present in the app?

Can a human visually see that it changed?

3. FUNCTIONAL TEST
If the change affects UI or functionality, did you test that it now works as intended?

Was the bug or failure resolved?

4. NO SIDE EFFECTS
Did you confirm that nothing else broke as a result of the change?

App still builds, runs, and retains all prior functionality?

5. USER CONFIRMABILITY
Is the change stored in a visible, editable file (if relevant)?

Can I inspect and confirm it without having to trust your summary?

IF YOU CANNOT CONFIRM ALL 5:
Do not say the task is complete.

Stop and explain which check failed.

Wait for further instruction.

DO NOT ASK ME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT TO DO. SIMPLY FIX ALL THE PROBLEMS. 
DO NOT CONTACT ME UNTIL THEY ARE FIXED. DO NOT STALL WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT YOU SHOULD DO. YOU HAVE YOUR ORDERS.
