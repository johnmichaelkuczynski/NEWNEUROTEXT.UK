BELOW THE COHERENCE FUNCTION THING AND ABOVE THE TEST STRICT OUTLINE GENERATOR, YIOU ARE GOING TO ADD A NEW FUNCTION: THE SCREENPLAY GENERATOR. THIS FUNCTION WILL USE THE LARGE-TEXT COHERENCE FUNCTIONALITYI THAT THE OTHER FUNCTIONS USE (THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL). HERE (UPLOADED) ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS: SCREENPLAY WRITER
The user provides source material (text, notes, outline, story concept, or any content). The user may optionally specify a target word count. If no word count is specified, default to 20,000 words. The user may also optionally provide custom instructions regarding tone, genre, character focus, setting, or any other creative direction. If no custom instructions are provided, interpret the source material and construct the most coherent and compelling screenplay possible from it.
Output requirements:
The output must be a complete, properly formatted screenplay consisting of:

FADE IN at opening
Scene headings in the form INT. or EXT. followed by LOCATION followed by DAY or NIGHT
Action lines written in present tense describing only what is visible or audible
Character names in capitals, with a brief physical description on first appearance
Dialogue beneath character names
Parentheticals used sparingly for essential delivery instructions
Transitions such as CUT TO or FADE OUT used where appropriate
FADE OUT at closing

Structural requirements:

Three-act structure with approximately 25 percent for Act One, 50 percent for Act Two, and 25 percent for Act Three
Inciting incident within the first 10 percent
Midpoint reversal at approximately 50 percent
All-is-lost moment at approximately 75 percent
Climax at approximately 90 percent
Resolution in final scenes

Content requirements:

Visual storytelling only—no unfilmable content such as internal thoughts or emotions that cannot be shown
No camera directions unless absolutely essential
No prose narration
Present tense throughout
Dialogue and action in roughly equal proportion

Scaling:
The structural percentages and beat placements apply proportionally regardless of target word count. A 2,000-word screenplay follows the same structural ratios as a 20,000-word screenplay.
