YOU ARE GOING TO TEST OUT EACH OF THESE FUNCTIONS TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED THEM. 
HERE IS WHAT YOU WILL DO. 
TEST 1: YOU WILL ENTER THE FOLLOWING TEXT INTO THE BOX BUT NOT PUT INSTRUCTIONS: Classical logic fails as a tool for reasoning because it requires more intelligence to recognize that an inference instantiates a logical law than to see the inference's validity directly. This renders classical logic useless for competence-demanding inferences requiring genuine insight. A new system—System L—based on pattern recognition, meta-reasoning templates, and defeasible inference as embodied in AI, emphasizes discovery over formalization.  
TEST 2: YOU WILL ENTER ZERO TEXT AND IN THE INSTRUCTIONS BOX WRITE: WRITE A 2300 WORD PAPER ON CONNECTIONISM IN RELATION TO PSYCHOANALYSIS. 
TEST 3: YOU WILL ENTER ZERO TEXT AND IN THE INSTRUCTIONS BOX WRITE: EXPLAIN HOW KUCZYNSKI'S RATIONALISM DIFFERS FROM LEIBNIZ'S; USE AT LEAST 30 QUOTES FROM EACH AUTHOR. 
TEST 4: YOU WILL ENTER THE INSTRUCTIONS "TURN THE FOLLOWING INTO A 25000 WORD ESSAY" AND THEN YOU WILL ENTER THE FOLLOWING TEXT INTO THE BOX: Classical logic fails as a tool for reasoning because it requires more intelligence to recognize that an inference instantiates a logical law than to see the inference's validity directly. This renders classical logic useless for competence-demanding inferences requiring genuine insight. A new system—System L—based on pattern recognition, meta-reasoning templates, and defeasible inference as embodied in AI, emphasizes discovery over formalization.  
TEST 5: YOU WILL ENTER ZERO TEXT AND IN THE INSTRUCTIONS BOX WRITE: WRITE A 23000 WORD PAPER ON THE SHORTCOMINGS OF MONETARY ECONOMICS.
TEST 6: YOU WILL ENTER THE FOLOWING INSRUCTIONS: "WRITE A 28000 WORD MASTER'S THESIS ON HOW KUCZYNSKI'S LOGIC DIFFERS FROM FREGE'S; USE AT LEAST 30 QUOTES FROM EACH AUTHOR." YOU WILL ENTER THE FOLLOWING TEXT INTO THE TEXT BOX: kuczynski | Classical logic can assist with performance-demanding inferences but offers no help with competence-demanding inferences | AI Logic vs Classical Logic
kuczynski | System L represents a decisive break from classical logical frameworks by employing semantic networks that represent concepts as nodes in a vast web of relationships | System L Architecture
kuczynski | System L utilizes meta-reasoning patterns—higher-order templates for generating new inferences that go beyond simple deductive rules | System L Architecture
kuczynski | System L incorporates defeasible reasoning, allowing it to make provisional inferences that can later be revised in light of new information | System L Architecture
kuczynski | System L doesn't arrive at mathematical insights through brute-force calculation or pattern matching, but through guided insight about the structure of expressions | System L and Mathematics
kuczynski | The capacity for error is not just contingently but necessarily connected to rationality | Rationality and Error
kuczynski | Rationality requires the ability to discriminate between valid and invalid reasoning, which in turn requires the ability to recognize both | Rationality and Error
kuczynski | System L maintains a crucial distinction between discovery procedures and verification procedures | Discovery vs Justification
kuczynski | While System L uses inductive methods to discover solutions, it employs deductive methods to verify them when working in deductive domains | Discovery vs Justification
kuczynski | Mathematicians rarely proceed by pure deduction; they notice patterns, draw analogies, follow intuitions, and make educated guesses | Mathematical Discovery
kuczynski | The mathematician's insight about how to prove a theorem often comes through pattern recognition or analogy, but this insight isn't itself the proof—it's a guide to where the proof might be found | Mathematical Discovery
kuczynski | The real error of psychologism isn't the use of psychological or empirical insights in reasoning; the error is treating such insights as justifications rather than as tools of discovery | Psychologism
kuczynski | Classical logic is characterized by explicit rules of inference, step-by-step deduction, binary truth values, context-independence, and compositional semantics | Classical Logic Properties
kuczynski | System L is characterized by flexible search strategies, pattern-based reasoning, degrees of plausibility, context-sensitivity, and holistic processing | System L Properties
kuczynski | Ancient logic was suited to systematic human reasoning; modern mathematical logic was suited to mechanical computation; L-type systems are suited to artificial intelligence | Evolution of Logic
kuczynski | Classical logic is essentially a formalization system while System L is genuinely an inference engine | Logic Functions
kuczynski | The Prior Knowledge Principle states that if using a formal system requires us to already know what we're trying to find out, that system fails as a tool of discovery | Principles of Logic
kuczynski | The Efficiency Principle states that if using a formal system to solve a problem is more difficult than solving that problem directly, that system fails as a tool of reasoning | Principles of Logic
kuczynski | AI-logic is inherently ampliative, generating new knowledge, while classical logic is purely transformative, rearranging existing knowledge | AI Logic Properties
kuczynski | AI-logic can model counter-entropic processes while classical logic is limited to entropic processes | AI Logic Properties
kuczynski | AI-logic handles self-reference through probabilistic reasoning while classical logic falls into paradox or requires type restrictions | AI Logic and Self-Reference
