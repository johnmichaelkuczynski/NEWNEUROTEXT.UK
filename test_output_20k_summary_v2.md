# Test Run: 20,000 Word Expansion - Classical Logic Critique (Version 2)
# Date: 2026-01-08 13:17 UTC
# Test Type: Universal Expansion Service

## Input (172 words)
Six theses from Kuczynski on "AI Logic vs Classical Logic":
1. Classical logic fails because recognizing law instantiation requires more intelligence than direct validity recognition
2. Validity recognition is precondition for knowing validating laws exist
3. Classical logic codifies already-known valid inferences, creating paradoxically unhelpful formal system
4. Formal logical system demands more intellectual work than direct reasoning
5. Gödel showed arithmetic is not recursively definable, making logic-to-math reduction impossible
6. Logic organizes existing entailment knowledge, cannot generate new entailment relationships

## Custom Instructions
"EXPAND TO 20000 WORDS. Write a comprehensive academic thesis exploring these arguments about classical logic's limitations. Include: an abstract, introduction, detailed analysis of each thesis, discussion of Gödel's incompleteness results, implications for AI and reasoning systems, and a conclusion. Use formal academic register throughout. No bullet points."
